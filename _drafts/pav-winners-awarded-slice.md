### Aotearoa's top game devs were recognised in a deliciously desert themed night, and there were plenty of slices of pav to go around.

The awards honour the cream of the crop of this year's games and their New Zealand and Australian developers.

About 50 submissions from studios and indies for the prestigious awards were received by the New Zealand Game Developers Association for consideration.

The awards night, on the the last day of the NZ Game Developers Convention in Wellington, was once again held online to avoid becoming a superspreader event.
