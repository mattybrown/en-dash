### Aotearoa's top game devs were recognised in a deliciously desert themed night, and there were plenty of slices of pav to go around.

The awards honour the cream of the crop of this year's games from New Zealand and Australian

This year the awards received abound 50 submissions from studios and indies.

So on and so forth, etc.
