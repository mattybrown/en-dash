<p>Now in its eighth year, the annual Kiwi Game Starter (KGS) competition aims to put a spotlight on unpublished games and encourage kiwi developers to new heights.</p>

<p>And after Covid-wrought troubles scrapped the 2021 event, New Zealand Game Developers Association (NZGDA) competition organisers are excited to see what creative kiwi minds have dreamt up this time.</p>

<p>NZGDA chairperson Chelsea Rapp says originally, the competition was designed for games in the very early stages of development, but as the competition has gone on the calibre of games submitted has skyrocketed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMany of the games we are seeing year to year have a very high production value with very clear commercial viability,‚Äù Chelsea says.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs made choosing a winner incredibly challenging, something the judges have acknowledged for the past several years.‚Äù</p>

<p>The competition is different to other independent awards, as one of the criteria for entry is the game can‚Äôt be published yet.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGames in all stages of development are eligible but games that have already been released are ineligible for the competition,‚Äù she says.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese games are typically already being worked on and in many cases are done by teams working full-time jobs during the day and working on the game in their spare time.‚Äù</p>

<p>The cash is arguably the least of the prizes, with mentorship from well-established development studios and ongoing support part of the prize pool.</p>

<p>Many entrants have also seen commercial success.</p>

<p>Chelsea says the 2019 winner, Before We Leave by ≈åtepoti-based Balancing Monkey Games, was able to secure an exclusive deal with the Epic Game Store and sold more than 50,000 copies in its first six months.</p>

<p>Formed in 2017, Balancing Monkey Games started as a hobby. Kiwi Sam Barham began working on Before We Leave while juggling full-time work and fatherhood.</p>

<p>Now, Before We Leave has won multiple awards, getting a slice of Pav in 2020 for Excellence in Audio and the 2021 Freeplay Across the Ditch award.</p>

<p>The 2020 winner, Rose and Locket from studio Whistling Wizard, is in discussion with publishers for the launch of their game.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a testament to the scale of the talent in New Zealand and how valuable programs like KGS are for helping to get game businesses off the ground,‚Äù Chelsea says.</p>

<p>But the gaming industry isn‚Äôt all fluffy ducks.</p>

<p>A talent shortage, exacerbated by tight borders to slow the spread of COVID, is one of the biggest issues facing both the digital screen industries and the tech sector; one of the reasons why the University of Canterbury (UC) has sponsored the competition‚Äôs $25,000 grand prize.</p>

<p>The Christchurch-based university has been investing heavily in film production, game development and cross reality, recently announcing a new Digital Screen Campus - redeveloping 14 hectares of its Dovedale campus including four existing buildings.</p>

<p>UC Digital Screen Campus programme director Professor Andrew Phelps says the University‚Äôs support of the gaming sector is critical to help New Zealand‚Äôs content creation and digital media production capability grow.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to see the University of Canterbury continuing to support creativity and innovation in the gaming sector, as this is a key pillar of our larger effort centred on the creation of our Digital Screen Campus and associated efforts on economic growth in these sectors,‚Äù Andrew says.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI wish the very best to everyone that enters the competition and, regardless of who wins, I hope to see many great game ideas produced, expanded upon, and ultimately brought to market.‚Äù</p>

<p>The competition is judged in two rounds, with a panel of experts scoring each game‚Äôs originality, aesthetics, production and commercial viability.</p>

<p>The pre-selection round is usually made up of about 25 judges from the local game development industry who will choose three or four finalists.</p>

<p>The final judging round will be done by a group of industry veterans who will select the winner and the runner up.</p>

<p>Chelsea says the judges for 2022 haven‚Äôt been selected yet, but a call will go out next month.</p>

<p>A second prize of $10,000, provided by Amazon Web Services, is also up for grabs.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor the past few years, it‚Äôs been common for applicants to apply multiple times prior to commercial launch. For example, our 2019 winner was also a finalist in the 2018 competition.‚Äù</p>

<p>Entries open soon so keep an eye on the NZGDA Twitter.</p>
