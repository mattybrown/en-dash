<p>Taking the phrase, there‚Äôs an app for that, to the next level is Christchurch-based tech entrepreneur Adam Hutchison - whose new app is looking promising at treating phobias.</p>

<p>The virtual reality smartphone app, <a href="https://www.ovrcome.io/">oVRcome</a>, doesn‚Äôt play episodes of Nickelodeon‚Äôs excellent early 90‚Äôs show <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em> But it does help people face their fears.</p>

<p>And a recent study from the Christchurch branch of the University of Otago shows the app has serious potential in treating phobias.</p>

<p>Led by University of Otago associate professor Cameron Lacey from the Department of Psychological Medicine, the results from the trial showed a 75 per cent reduction in phobia symptoms after six weeks of the treatment programme.</p>

<p>Recently published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, the trial studied phobia patients using a headset and a smartphone app treatment programme ‚Äì a combination of Virtual Reality (VR) 360‚Äëdegree video exposure therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</p>

<p>It‚Äôs thought about one-in-twelve people worldwide suffer from a fear of flying, needles, heights, spiders and dogs while nearly a fifth of people have an anxiety disorder such as social anxiety or a phobia, the vast majority suffering in silence.</p>

<p>‚ÄúParticipants demonstrated a strong acceptability of the app, highlighting its potential for delivering easily accessible, cost-effective treatment at scale, of particular use for those unable to access in-person exposure therapy to treat their phobias,‚Äù Lacey says.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe improvements they reported suggests there‚Äôs great potential for the use of VR and mobile phone apps as a means of self-guided treatment for people struggling with often-crippling phobias.‚Äù</p>

<p>A total of 129 people took part in the six-week randomised, controlled trial, between May 2021 and December 2021, with a 12-week follow-up.</p>

<p>Participants had to be aged between 18‚Äì64 years, and have a fear of flying, heights, needles, spiders or dogs. They were emailed weekly questionnaires to record their progress. Those experiencing adverse events could request contact from a clinical psychologist at any stage.</p>

<p>‚ÄúParticipants experiencing all five types of phobia showed comparable improvements in the Severity Measures for Specific Phobia scale over the course of the trial. The average severity score decreased from 28/40 (moderate to severe symptoms) to 7/40 (minimal symptoms) after six weeks. There were no participant withdrawals due to intervention-related adverse events.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe oVRcome app involves what‚Äôs called ‚Äúexposure therapy‚Äù, a form of CBT exposing participants to their specific phobias in short bursts, to build up their tolerance to the phobia in a clinically-approved and controlled way,‚Äù Lacey says.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSome participants reported significant progress in overcoming their phobias after the trial period, with one feeling confident enough to now book an overseas family holiday, another lining up for a COVID vaccine and another reporting they now felt confident not only knowing there was a spider in the house but that they could possibly remove it themselves.‚Äù</p>

<p>Lacey says public demand to take part in the trial was unprecedented, demonstrating the increasing need and desire for phobia treatment in the community.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAn estimated ten per cent of New Zealanders have been hesitant to take part in the government‚Äôs COVID‚Äë19 vaccination programme due to needle phobia. This hasn‚Äôt been helped by a significant shortage of psychologists. A petition to Parliament last year claimed New Zealand is 1,000 psychologists short, causing ballooning wait times nationwide, making it difficult for people to access help if needed. We need to further research and explore the use of more cost-effective, easily-accessible, home-based solutions such as this oVRcome app, to provide people with the treatment and support they need.‚Äù</p>
